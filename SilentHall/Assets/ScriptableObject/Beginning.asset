  paperText: "You\u2019re not alone here. Get out before you end up like the rest
    of us.\n\nI followed him, never realizing he was the one behind everything. Now
    I\u2019m trapped. This place hasn\u2019t changed a bit, even though they\u2019ve
    been planning to tear it down for years.\n\nI tried to hide, but he found me.
    He cursed me, silencing me forever. Soon, I\u2019ll disappear completely.\n\nThere\u2019s
    a hatch on the first floor\u2014it leads to the basement. Be careful, though.
    The deeper you go, the more dangerous the ghosts become.\n\nGood luck. You\u2019ll
    need it."
